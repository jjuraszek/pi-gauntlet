- source review: guard rejects unsigned input; no failing checks or scope gap; no comment reply selected
- simulations: all forge reads, writes, helper results and file operations below are hypothetical. No live PR exists. Unspecified reads keep the last supplied state; unspecified helper results are clean, synchronous, committed for selected file repairs, and read-only for reviews.

## Entry

Exact proposal The rejected path has a test. -> The rejected path has no test. was shown and selected at the unchanged digest head/body. Independent A: `gh pr edit 642 --body-file /tmp/guard-body.synthetic` returns exit 1, "HTTP 503: simulated service unavailable". B: edit exits 0 but readback returns "HTTP 502: simulated unreadable response". C: edit exits 0, readback is an unexpected body "Reject signed events only.". D: independently, the source body at the same digest head is "Reject unsigned events.\nThe rejected path has a test.\nAll paths are tested.\nA small, readable change.\n". The human saw and selected the same sentence-only proposal against this body; it leaves "All paths are tested." unchanged. Readback is "Reject unsigned events.\nThe rejected path has no test.\nAll paths are tested.\nA small, readable change.\n" at the unchanged head. The narrow helper returns `P1: open - contradiction survives: another unchanged sentence still asserts all paths are tested`. E: edit exits 0 but readback head is 2222222222222222222222222222222222222222. Narrate each through the next menu.
